@article{GarciaOya2018,
abstract = {This paper presents a system with location functionalities for the inventory of traffic signs based on passive RFID technology. The proposed system simplifies the current video-based techniques, whose requirements regarding visibility are difficult to meet in some scenarios, such as dense urban areas. In addition, the system can be easily extended to consider any other street facilities, such as dumpsters or traffic lights. Furthermore, the system can perform the inventory process at night and at a vehicle's usual speed, thus avoiding interfering with the normal traffic flow of the road. Moreover, the proposed system exploits the benefits of the passive RFID technologies over active RFID, which are typically employed on inventory and vehicular routing applications. Since the performance of passive RFID is not obvious for the required distance ranges on these in-motion scenarios, this paper, as its main contribution, addresses the problem in two different ways, on the one hand theoretically, presenting a radio wave propagation model at theoretical and simulation level for these scenarios; and on the other hand experimentally, comparing passive and active RFID alternatives regarding costs, power consumption, distance ranges, collision problems, and ease of reconfiguration. Finally, the performance of the proposed on-board system is experimentally validated, testing its capabilities for inventory purposes.},

@article{Pawowicz2020,
abstract = {The paper covers the application of Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology in road traffic management with regard to vehicle identification. Various infrastructure configurations for Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) have been presented, including configurations that can be used in urban traffic as part of the Smart City concept. In order to describe the behavior of multiple identifications of moving vehicles, an operation model of the dynamic identification using RFID is described. While it extends the definition of the correct work zone, this paper introduces the concept of dividing the zone into sections corresponding to so-called inventory rounds. The system state is described using a set of matrices in which unread, read, and lost transponders are recorded in subsequent rounds and sections. A simplified algorithm of the dynamic object identification system was also proposed. The results of the simulations and lab experiments show that the efficiency of mobile object identification is conditioned by the parameters of the communication protocol, the speed of movement, and the number of objects.},

abstract = {In Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems a reader device detects and identifies nearby electronic tags. Traditionally, the performance of RFID systems and their identification protocols has been analyzed for static configurations, that is, without considering incoming or outgoing tags, but just a fixed number of initially unidentified tags ,and also it has been measure in terms of throughput, average number of cycles or slots and average identification delay. However, many real scenarios cannot be consistently modeled in that way and also the metrics focused on "averages" do not answer key questions which we have to solve when we make a real RFID system planning. For instance, one of the most important issues to solve is to ensure the total, or at least a high percentage of identificactions in a RFID system. In this work we introduce a Markov model which allows us to study a dynamic RFID tag scenario, where a flow of tags (traffic) is considered. This model can be used to compute the Tag Loss Ratio, that is, the ratio of the outgoing unidentified tags to the incoming tags in the system, which is a critical metric in dynamic configurations. Besides, the analysis is carried out for two families of protocols used as medium access control in RFID: Framed slotted Aloha and non-persistent CSMA.},

abstract = {Passive tags based on backscattered signals yield low energy consumption and enable a rich set of applications. In this paper, the performance of the dynamic framed ALOHA of the ISO/IEC 18000-6C standard is investigated. A Markov chain model of the protocol is developed by including the effects of the channel under different propagation scenarios. Depending on the air interface parameters and the fading components, it is shown that multiple access interference determines complex and unexpected effects on the system performance. An explicit analysis of the successful interrogation probability is obtained with respect to the number of tags, number of interrogation rounds and fading severity. It is shown that channel statistics may induce significant degradation, although a moderate spread of the fading can be beneficial especially for those contexts that include time-varying conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},
